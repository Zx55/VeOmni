"""Per-module CPU preprocessing contract and HF-asset binding onto a live module.

Terminology (three different "processor" layers)
------------------------------------------------
* **HF asset — ``XxxProcessor``** (in each ``modules/*/processing.py``):
  HuggingFace-style checkpoint sidecar — image processor, tokenizer, etc.
  Saved/loaded via ``save_pretrained`` / ``from_pretrained`` on the asset itself.
  Holds resize / normalize constants; no ``nn.Module`` weights.

* **Module CPU worker — ``XxxPreprocessor(ModulePreprocessorBase)``** (same file):
  Picklable, weight-free object run inside DataLoader workers (training) or
  once before the generation FSM (inference).  Usually *wraps* the HF asset
  (``self._image_processor``, ``self._tokenizer``, …) and mutates the collator
  ``batch`` dict in place via ``__call__``.

* **Omni orchestrator — ``OmniProcessor``** (``processing_omni.py``):
  Composes one ``XxxPreprocessor`` per active graph module — the SeedOmni
  analogue of HuggingFace ``AutoProcessor``.

This module is the **middle** layer: the abstract CPU-worker base, plus
:func:`bind_module_assets` which copies those assets onto a live
:class:`~veomni.models.seed_omni.modules.module_modeling_base.PretrainedOmniModule`.
Each module's native model class declares ``preprocessor_class = XxxPreprocessor``.

    Subclass as ``XxxPreprocessor`` in ``modules/<family>/<sub>/processing.py``.
    The HF asset (``XxxProcessor`` / tokenizer) lives in the same file but is a
    separate class — do not confuse the two.

    Contract:

    * **No model weights, no model instance.** It is pickled / fork-inherited into
      worker processes, so it must hold only CPU-safe, picklable assets (tokenizer /
      image processor / special-token ids / config ints) — never the ``nn.Module``.
      :meth:`from_pretrained` builds it straight from a module's checkpoint
      subfolder — mirroring HuggingFace's ``XxxProcessor.from_pretrained`` — with
      **no dependency on any live/real model** (weight-free or otherwise).
    * **CPU only.** Workers must not touch the training CUDA device; build CPU
      tensors (no ``device=``).  The main process's thin ``pre_forward`` does the
      single ``.to(device)``.
    * **In-place mutation.** ``__call__`` receives the collator ``batch`` dict
      and mutates it in place. Subclasses decide which keys they read and write.
    * **Shared by training + inference.** Training runs it inside a collator
      (DataLoader worker); inference runs it once over the request before the
      FSM. The ``inference`` flag flips train/infer-only behaviour.
