"""
GenerationGraph: FSM view over inline edge lists for inference.

The FSM drives multi-modal generation by cycling through *named states*.
Each state specifies:

  body
      An ordered list of inline **edges** (``{from, to}`` dicts whose endpoints
      are ``module[.method]`` strings; a bare module defaults to ``.generate``).
      Per FSM step the body is walked in **topological order**:

      1. Pre-compute, per node ``X`` appearing in body, the count of
         body edges with ``to: X`` (its in-body fan-in).
      2. Walk the body edges in declaration order.  For each edge ``e``:

         a. Ensure ``e.from_`` is executed.  If it has any unprocessed
            in-body fan-in, that's a body-ordering bug — error.
         b. Decrement ``e.to``'s pending fan-in.  ``pending`` is a gate on
            a later ``from_`` appearance of that node, not a trigger to
            run ``e.to``.  A node that only appears as ``to:`` is never
            executed; pin a leaf with ``{from: leaf, to: end}``.

      Each executed node merges its return dict into ``ctx`` directly
      (``ctx.update(out)``).  Edges declare execution order only — they
      do not route individual fields.  Modules write whatever keys the next
      node needs onto ``ctx`` (``input_ids``, ``hidden_states``, …).

      This rule generalises "first-encounter execution":

        * For purely linear bodies (e.g. ``s1`` =
          ``module_A → module_B → module_C``) it executes every node exactly
          once, in declaration order.
        * For multi-source nodes (``module_B`` consumes keys written by both
          ``module_A`` and ``module_C``) the backbone executes only after the
          last in-body fan-in edge has fired — both keys are already
          in ``ctx`` from upstream ``ctx.update(out)`` calls.
        * For self-feedback bodies (``s2`` =
          ``module_B → module_A, module_A → module_B``) ``module_A`` writes
          a key into ``ctx``; the next ``module_B`` step reads it directly —
          no edge renaming.

      An edge with ``to: end`` is purely declarative — it pins the producing
      node into the active set without routing anywhere.

Default method
--------------
A bare endpoint (``module`` with no ``.method``) defaults to ``generate`` in the
FSM view.  A dotted endpoint (``module.method`` — e.g. ``encode``, ``decode``,
``emit_image_start``) is taken verbatim on the yielded :class:`NodeDef`.

  transitions
      Ordered list of ``{condition: ..., next_state: S}`` items checked after
      every iteration of the state body.  First matching condition wins.

      A state has **no iteration-count budget**: its body runs once and then
      keeps iterating until one of its transitions fires.  Modules — not the
      FSM — decide when a state ends, either by raising a signal (the AR
      loop case) or implicitly after a single pass (the bridge/leaf case,
      via a ``default`` transition).  Supported conditions:

        ``{type: module_signal, key: K}``
            Fires when ``context["module_signal"] == K``.  Modules write a
            one-shot string signal into ``ctx["module_signal"]`` from inside
            ``generate_step`` / ``decode`` (e.g. ``module_A.decode`` sets
            ``"advance"`` / ``"done"``).  The framework **auto-clears**
            ``ctx["module_signal"]`` once the transition fires.  This is how
            an AR loop state keeps iterating until its module says "done".
            The FSM never inspects raw token ids — vocabulary semantics stay
            inside the module.

        ``{type: default}``
            The catch-all (switch-``default``) branch — matches
            unconditionally.  Because transitions are evaluated in order and
            the first match wins, a ``default`` is the lowest-priority
            **fallback**: it fires only when none of the conditions listed
            *before* it matched.  It MUST therefore be the last transition in
            a state (the FSM rejects a ``default`` that isn't, since any
            transition after it would be dead code).  Two uses:

            * sole transition on a deterministic single-pass bridge / leaf
              state (prompt encode, ``<boi>`` / ``<eoi>`` emit) — run the
              body once, then advance;
            * the else-branch after one or more ``module_signal`` checks
              (e.g. "sampled a normal text token → keep decoding").

Usage
-----
  >>> fsm = GenerationGraph(config.generation_graph)
  >>> fsm.reset()
  >>> ctx = {"input_ids": ..., "attention_mask": ...}
  >>> while not fsm.is_done():
  ...     for node in fsm.iter_nodes(ctx):          # graph selects; caller runs
  ...         run_node(modules, node, ctx)
  ...     fsm.maybe_transition(ctx)

           ``edge.from_``.
        2. Walk ``state.body`` edges in declaration order. For each edge ``e``:

           a. If ``e.from_`` hasn't run yet, yield it now. (If it still has
              unprocessed in-body fan-in, that's a body-ordering bug — raise.)

              once its later ``from_`` appearance is reached.

        ``end`` is a virtual sink and is never yielded; an edge with ``to: end``
        only pins its ``from_`` node into the active set. The same node never
        re-runs within one body iteration.

        Visual conventions
        ------------------
        Each non-``done`` state is rendered as a labelled subgraph whose
        interior is a mini-flow over the body's topology edges (``to: end`` sink
        edges are filtered out since they don't carry data — they only
        pin a node into the body).  The body's node names inside the
        subgraph are namespaced as ``<state>__<node>`` so the same node
        can appear in multiple states without ID collisions.

        State transitions are thick arrows (``==>``) carrying the firing
        condition (e.g. ``module_signal(start_image_gen)``, ``default``).
        The line weight + simpler label distinguishes them visually from
        the intra-body data edges.

        A small ``▶`` node marks FSM entry; a small ``⏹`` terminal absorbs
        every transition that targets the built-in ``done`` state.  The
        ``done`` state itself is NOT drawn — its body is empty by
        construction (framework-injected, not user-declared), and
        rendering it would just add a redundant box.

        Layout uses ``flowchart LR`` + the ELK renderer so major FSM states
        read left-to-right. State bodies use ``direction TB`` so multi-step
        states stay readable instead of stretching into a single wide strip.
