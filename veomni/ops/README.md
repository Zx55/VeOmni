# `veomni.ops`

`veomni.ops` owns VeOmni's tensor-level operation registry and concrete kernel
implementations. Model-specific input normalization, Hugging Face-compatible
signatures, and loss policy belong in `veomni.models`.

Importing `veomni.ops` registers every built-in op family and applies
the process-wide attention integration from `install.py`.

```

Python modules maintained by VeOmni document every module, class, and
callable. Directories named `vendor/` mirror external implementations and
retain their upstream source layout and documentation style.

Registered rows use the identity:

```text
(op, variant, implementation, device)
```

Callers select the public `(op, variant, implementation)` triple. The
registry derives `device` from the row's requirement and resolves the current
device first, followed by a device-agnostic row. A row's `requires` metadata
is then checked for discoverable optional module paths without importing vendor
code. This is a static discovery check; actual vendor initialization happens
when the selected implementation runs.

## Built-in families

| Op | Variants | Implementations |
|---|---|---|
| `attention` | `standard` | `eager`, `sdpa`, and FlashAttention/FlexAttention/MagiAttention/SageAttention names |
| `async_ulysses_qkv`, `async_ulysses_o` | `standard`, `dit` | `eager` orchestration |
| `rms_norm` | `standard`, `deepseek_v4`, `unweighted`, `offset` | `eager`, `liger_kernel`, `npu`, and `triton` where supported; all accept optional `group_size` (fused weighted rows delegate grouped calls to eager) |
| `layer_norm` | `standard` | `eager`, `apex` (`fused_layer_norm_cuda`); nested by async Ulysses QKV when `norm_type="layernorm"` |
| `rope` | `full`, `partial`, `interleave`, `mrope`, `deepseek_v4`, `wan` | `eager`, `liger_kernel`, `npu`, and `triton` where supported; `full` also accepts rank-3 vision layout |
| `swiglu_mlp` | `standard`, `geglu` | `eager`, `liger_kernel` |
| `moe_experts` | `standard`, `gpt_oss` | `eager`, `fused_triton`, `fused_quack`, `fused_npu`, `fused_mlu` as supported by the variant |
| `moe_experts_lora` | `independent`, `shared` | `eager`, `fused_triton`, `fused_npu` |
| `cross_entropy_loss` | `standard` | `eager`, `chunk_loss`, `liger_kernel` |
| `load_balancing_loss` | `standard` | `eager`, `triton` |
| `rms_norm_gated`, `causal_conv1d`, `chunk_gated_delta_rule` | `standard` | `eager`, `fla`, `flash_qla`, `npu`, `npu_ascendc` as supported by the family |
| `dsa_indexer`, `dsa_attention` | `deepseek_v4`, `glm` | `eager`, `tilelang`, `cudnn`, or `flashmla_cudnn` by variant |
| `mhc` | `pre`, `post`, `head` | `eager`, `tilelang` |

DeepSeek-V4 `dsa_attention` treats `topk_idxs` as candidate slots. Repeated
valid indices participate once per occurrence, matching the TileLang kernel;
invalid sentinel entries contribute no attention mass. With `return_lse=True`,
both implementations return a detached base-2 log-sum-exp tensor.

The registry is the source of truth for the exact rows available in a given
revision:

```python
from veomni.ops import OP_REGISTRY

OP_REGISTRY.list_registered("rms_norm", "standard")
OP_REGISTRY.list_available("rms_norm", "standard")
OP_REGISTRY.list_entries("rms_norm", "standard")
```

`list_registered` includes every known implementation. `list_available`
filters those rows using the current device, hardware requirement, and
discoverable optional-module requirements.
`list_entries` returns the complete device-specific rows, including their
descriptions, hardware requirements, and package requirements; an
implementation registered for multiple devices therefore appears more than
once.

FlexAttention is registered for NVIDIA GPUs. Its adapter selects FA4 on SM90+
when supported and otherwise uses Triton. MagiAttention requires NVIDIA SM100+
and is optional; install it with:

```bash
uv sync --extra gpu --extra magi --dev
```

## Registering an op

Each row provides either:

- a raw `forward` and `backward` pair, from which the registry generates a
  `torch.autograd.Function` wrapper; or
- one opaque `wrapper`, for eager PyTorch or a library API that already owns
  its autograd behavior.

Do not provide both forms for one row.

```python
from veomni.ops import register_op
from veomni.ops.platform import GpuKernelRequirement, NvidiaGpuPlatform

register_op(
    "example",
    "standard",
    "eager",
    description="PyTorch reference implementation of the example operation",
    wrapper=eager_example,
)

register_op(
    "example",
    "standard",
    "triton",
    forward=triton_forward,
    backward=triton_backward,
    description="Triton implementation of the example operation",
    requirement=GpuKernelRequirement(platforms=(NvidiaGpuPlatform(min_cc=80),)),
    requires=("triton",),
)
```

Descriptions identify the implementation source, algorithm, layout, or other
stable semantic differences. Device and compute-capability support belong in
the hardware requirement, while optional import packages belong in `requires`,
so availability metadata cannot drift into the description.

For a raw pair, `forward` returns `(output, SavedState)`, and `backward`
returns one gradient entry for every positional tensor passed to the generated
wrapper. Tensor inputs must therefore be positional; non-tensor attributes
must be keyword arguments.

```python
from veomni.ops.registry import SavedState


def raw_forward(x, *, scale):
    return x * scale, SavedState((), scale)


def raw_backward(grad_output, saved):
    return (grad_output * saved.metadata,)
```

An explicit non-eager selection never silently falls back. Unknown rows raise
`KeyError`; rows for the wrong device, unmet hardware requirements, or missing
optional packages raise `RuntimeError` during resolution.

## Calling an op from modeling

Models construct a local handle once and call it directly:

```python
from veomni.ops import VeomniOp
from veomni.ops.config import resolve_op_impl


self.veomni_rms_norm = VeomniOp(
    "rms_norm",
    "standard",
    resolve_op_impl("rms_norm_implementation"),
)

hidden_states = self.veomni_rms_norm(hidden_states, self.weight, eps=self.variance_epsilon)
```

`VeomniOp` resolves its row at construction, is interned by the public
triple, and always calls the row's wrapper. `models.build_foundation_model`
installs the `OpsImplementationConfig` object in `ops/config.py` before
constructing the model.

The registry wrapper is the canonical tensor contract for an op variant;
it is not a collection of model-specific adapters. Transformations that vary
by consumer stay with that consumer. For example:

- causal shifting and sequence-parallel loss reduction live in
  `models/loss_utils/cross_entropy_loss.py`;
- concatenating per-layer router logits and applying attention masks live in
  `models/loss_utils/load_balancing_loss.py`;
- generated model patches construct the appropriate variant and translate
  model-owned parameters into its tensor contract.

## Compound ops

A compound raw op must call another row's raw `forward`/`backward`, not its
autograd wrapper. `compound.py` provides `resolve_inner_op`, `append_inner`,
and `take_inner` so nested `SavedState` tensors and metadata can be flattened
into the outer custom-autograd state.

## Process-wide integrations

The `sdpa` and `veomni_sdpa` attention rows accept ordinary dense attention
masks but do not expose a packed/varlen API. `packed_causal_mask` rejects these
implementations, and their attention calls and the VeOmni SDPA mask builder
reject non-null cumulative-length or varlen maximum-length metadata. Packing
must use a packed-capable implementation. This follows the public
[`torch.nn.functional.scaled_dot_product_attention` signature](https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.functional.scaled_dot_product_attention.html),
which has `attn_mask` but no `cu_seqlens` arguments. Opaque dense masks are not
inspected to infer whether they encode sequence boundaries.

The VeOmni SDPA mask builder only honors causal mask-elision hints for the
canonical causal predicate with equal Q/K lengths and offsets. Bidirectional
elision requires the canonical bidirectional predicate and an explicit hint.
Sliding-window and custom predicates always retain an explicit mask, including
when callers enable skip hints. Transformers still checks padding before any
permitted elision. Eager shape masks always request an explicit mask.

`install.py` contains idempotent process-wide integration only. Currently it
registers VeOmni attention names and mask builders on Transformers registries
and patches the Transformers hub-kernel loader for local FlashAttention
implementations. It is skipped when `MODELING_BACKEND=hf`.

`batch_invariant/` is deliberately separate from `kernels/`: it temporarily
patches ATen implementations through `set_batch_invariant_mode(...)` and is not
selected through `VeomniOp`.

## Tests and further documentation

- Registry and generated-autograd contract: `tests/ops/base/test_op_entry.py`
- Per-family math and hardware behavior: `tests/ops/<family>/`
- Model-facing integration and helpers: `tests/models/`
- User-facing selection and lifecycle: `docs/design/op_selection.md`
- Breaking change map from OpSlot: `docs/design/opslot_to_veomniop.md`

When adding a row, test its numerical contract, registration, hardware
requirement, and optional-package requirements. When adding model-specific
argument policy, test it in `tests/models` rather than duplicating it in
the raw-kernel suite.
