# VeOmni Flash Attention Custom Name Adapter (Transformers 5.x)

## Problem Background

VeOmni uses custom attention implementation names:

- `veomni_flash_attention_2`
- `veomni_flash_attention_2_hub`
- `veomni_flash_attention_3`
- `veomni_flash_attention_3_hub`
- `veomni_flash_attention_4`

These names are registered into `ALL_ATTENTION_FUNCTIONS` and routed to VeOmni's SP-aware attention wrapper.

With Transformers 5.x, model init and flash-attention preload logic may still call
`transformers.modeling_flash_attention_utils._lazy_imports(...)` for the configured implementation string.
For non-native names, `_lazy_imports` falls back to hub-kernel loading and can fail with:

`ValueError: Could not find the currently requested flash attention implementation at veomni_flash_attention_2`

even though VeOmni already registered the custom attention function.

## Why This Happens

The failure path is:

1. Model config keeps VeOmni custom name in `_attn_implementation`.
2. Transformers flash preload code tries to resolve low-level flash kernels from the implementation string.
3. Custom VeOmni names are not hub kernel identifiers.
4. Hub fallback returns no valid kernel entry for this name.
5. `_lazy_imports` raises before normal `ALL_ATTENTION_FUNCTIONS` dispatch takes effect.

## Adapter Strategy Implemented

Instead of patching `_lazy_imports` directly, VeOmni patches:

`transformers.integrations.hub_kernels.load_and_register_attn_kernel`

and intercepts VeOmni custom names only.
This compatibility adapter is applied only when `transformers>=5.0.0`.

For VeOmni names, the adapter returns a kernel-like object exposing:

- `flash_attn_func`
- `flash_attn_varlen_func`

mapped to local or explicitly selected Hub FA2/FA3/FA4 backends:

- `veomni_flash_attention_2` -> `flash_attn.flash_attn_func` / `flash_attn.flash_attn_varlen_func`
- `veomni_flash_attention_2_hub` -> pinned `kernels-community/flash-attn2` version 1 functions
- `veomni_flash_attention_3` -> `flash_attn_interface.flash_attn_func` / `flash_attn_interface.flash_attn_varlen_func`
- `veomni_flash_attention_3_hub` -> pinned `kernels-community/flash-attn3` version 1 functions
- `veomni_flash_attention_4` -> `flash_attn.cute.flash_attn_func` / `flash_attn.cute.flash_attn_varlen_func`

For simplicity, paged VeOmni aliases (for example `paged|veomni_flash_attention_2`) are not handled by this adapter.

All non-VeOmni implementations are delegated to the original Transformers loader unchanged.

## Design Goals

- Keep VeOmni custom implementation names unchanged.
- Keep existing VeOmni `ALL_ATTENTION_FUNCTIONS.register(...)` behavior unchanged.
- Avoid accidental hub-kernel lookup for VeOmni private names; the explicit FA2/FA3 hub backends are the only opt-in exceptions.
- Minimize patch surface by touching a single integration point.
- Fail fast with clear ImportError when required FA backend is missing.

## Expected Runtime Behavior

After `import veomni`:

- VeOmni custom names remain registered in `ALL_ATTENTION_FUNCTIONS`.
- `_lazy_imports("veomni_flash_attention_2")` and `_lazy_imports("veomni_flash_attention_4")` can resolve through the adapter.
- No spurious "kernel hub name not found" error for VeOmni custom names.
- Paged VeOmni aliases are outside the adapter scope.

## Notes

- This adapter is a compatibility bridge for Transformers 5.x behavior around flash preload.
- It does not change VeOmni SP attention semantics.
- Hub FA2/FA3 require `MODELING_BACKEND=veomni` and are rejected on Ascend NPU, including their normalized `veomni_*_hub` aliases. Config parsing and model construction reject these requests before HF preloading, which would otherwise silently select built-in NPU attention instead of the requested Hub kernel.
- Local FA2/FA3/FA4 names do not require the `kernels` Python package. The explicit `flash_attention_2_hub` and `flash_attention_3_hub` backends require `kernels`, which is included in the GPU extra, and download or reuse version 1 of `kernels-community/flash-attn2` or `kernels-community/flash-attn3`, respectively.
- FA2 and local FA3 have dedicated branches in `_lazy_imports` and are resolved
  directly without reaching the hub-kernel path. The adapter is therefore a
  no-op for those two in practice, but is kept for safety.
- FA4 (`veomni_flash_attention_4`) has no such branch in
  `_lazy_imports` and always falls through to the hub-kernel path. The
  adapter is the **critical** component that makes FA4 usable.
- FA4 requires the `flash-attn-4` package (`flash_attn.cute`), shipped
  in the `gpu` extra; `uv sync --extra gpu` installs it from PyPI.
  MagiAttention's companion `flash-attn-cute` package (`flash_attn_cute`)
  is separate and lives in the optional `magi` extra.
