# MiniMax H3 FL2VA Quick Start

This guide walks through **training** and **inference** for MiniMax H3 FL2VA (first/last frame + text -> video + audio) on an Ascend NPU machine. Every command can be copied and run directly.

- Verified environment: 4 Ascend NPUs, torch_npu + torchrun
- Verified flow: two-stage offline training (embedding -> offline) for 30 steps + single-card inference

## 1. Model

```shell
modelscope download --model MiniMax/MiniMax-H3 \
    --local_dir pretrained_models/MiniMax-H3
```

---

## 2. Data Format

### 2.1 Directory Layout

During Stage 1 (offline embedding), if no keyframe images are provided, the first and last frames are extracted from the video itself.

```
dataset/my_data/
├── metadata.csv          # index file (must be named metadata.csv, or set via train_path in the config)
├── video.mp4             # training video
├── first.png             # (optional) first-frame keyframe for inference
└── last.png              # (optional) last-frame keyframe for inference
```

### 2.2 metadata.csv Format

The following 4 columns are **required**, with fixed column names:

```text
video,prompt,input_audio,frame_rate
video.mp4,"A girl is very happy, she is speaking in english.",video.mp4,24
```

| Column | Required | Meaning |
|:---|:-----|:-----|
| `video` | Yes | Video file name (relative to the CSV directory) |
| `prompt` | Yes | Text description (matches the video content) |
| `input_audio` | Yes | Audio source; set to `video.mp4` to use the video's own audio track |
| `frame_rate` | Yes | Frame rate; set to `24` |

### 2.3 Hard Video Constraints (violations raise errors)

| Constraint | Value | Notes |
|:-----|:---|:-----|
| Frame count | **124** (must satisfy `(num_frames-5) % 17 == 0`) | The Video VAE groups frames by 17; 124 is the demo-config value. 73, 107, 141, etc. are also legal (`(N-5) % 17 == 0`) |
| Resolution | **480x832** (height x width) | Must be divisible by the VAE downsampling factor |
| Frame rate | 24 | `fps: 24` in the config; audio latent length is computed as `num_frames/24*40` |
| Audio | 32kHz stereo | Audio is resampled to 32kHz automatically; videos without audio fail during training |

## 3. Training (Two Stages, Step by Step)

### Step 1: Run Stage 1 (offline embedding)

```shell
# MiniMax H3 FL2VA
# Offline embedding
bash train.sh tasks/train_dit.py configs/dit/minimax_h3_fl2va_embedding.yaml
```

What Stage 1 does:

- Loads Video VAE / Audio VAE / Text Encoder (**does not load the DiT**)
- Encodes video/audio/text -> VAE latents + prompt embeddings + packed-sequence info
- Writes one parquet per card: `output/minimax_h3_fl2va_embedding/rank_<rank>_shard_0.parquet`
- Success marker: process exits with no traceback

### Step 2: Switch to Stage 2 (offline training)

```shell
bash train.sh tasks/train_dit.py configs/dit/minimax_h3_fl2va_offline.yaml
```

What Stage 2 does:

- Loads the DiT (FSDP2 + gradient checkpointing + bf16), **skips** the VAE/Text Encoder (`skip_encoder_load: true`)
- Reads parquet -> adds noise -> DiT forward/backward -> AdamW update

## 4. Training Config Notes

Two config files:

| Stage | Config | Training task |
|:-----|:-----|:---------|
| Stage 1 | `configs/dit/minimax_h3_fl2va_embedding.yaml` | `training_task: offline_embedding` |
| Stage 2 | `configs/dit/minimax_h3_fl2va_offline.yaml` | `training_task: offline_training` |

### Stage 1 Config (embedding)

```yaml
model:
  condition_model_path: pretrained_models/MiniMax-H3/MiniMax/MiniMax-H3/FL2VA
  condition_model_cfg:
    base_model_path: pretrained_models/MiniMax-H3/MiniMax/MiniMax-H3/FL2VA
    video_vae_subfolder: video_vae/source   # VAE weights subfolder
    skip_encoder_load: false                # Stage 1 must be false (encoders are loaded)
    use_keyframe_condition: true
    keyframe_indices: [0, -1]               # first frame + last frame
    video_max_frames: 73                    # max video latent frame groups
    video_max_resolution: 848
    sigma_shift_video: 12.0
    sigma_shift_audio: 3.0

data:
  train_path: dataset/minimax-h3-demo/minimax_h3/MiniMax-H3-FL2VA/metadata.csv
  data_transform: minimax_h3_online         # Stage 1 encodes raw video online
  datasets_type: mapping
  dataloader:
    num_workers: 0                          # Stage 1 is encode-heavy; use 0 workers to avoid memory contention
    drop_last: false
  mm_configs:
    data_dir: dataset/minimax-h3-demo/minimax_h3/MiniMax-H3-FL2VA/
    fps: 24
    min_frames: 124
    max_frames: 124
    height: 480
    width: 832
  offline_embedding_save_dir: output/minimax_h3_fl2va_embedding   # Stage 2 reads from here
```

**Important**:

- `train_path` must point to the **metadata.csv file** (or a directory that contains it). Directories are scanned for `parquet` / `json` / `csv` / `arrow` files only, so leftover images or `veomni_cli.yaml` are ignored.
- When changing data, `fps/min_frames/max_frames/height/width` must match the actual video parameters; the frame count must satisfy `(N-5) % 17 == 0`
- `offline_embedding_save_dir` must match Stage 2's `data.train_path`

### Stage 2 Config (offline training)

```yaml

  model_path: pretrained_models/MiniMax-H3/MiniMax/MiniMax-H3/FL2VA/transformer

```

## Packed Offline Training

With `train.micro_batch_size > 1`, H3 packs samples inside its ordinary forward.
Both **FL2VA** and **visual Ref2VA** (image/video references, without reference
audio) use `process_condition(**batch) → model(**batch)` and return sample-mean
scalar losses. There is no Trainer packing switch or alternate output protocol.
The recipe defaults to one sample. This does not batch inference requests,
enable dynamic batching, load new encoders, or implement an RL objective.

Use the offline recipe with the updated packed metadata:

```shell
bash train.sh tasks/train_dit.py configs/dit/minimax_h3_fl2va_offline.yaml \
  --train.micro_batch_size 2 \
  --train.global_batch_size 16
```

Keep `train.dyn_bsz=false`, `data.dataloader.drop_last=true`, and FSDP2
`mixed_precision.cast_forward_inputs=false`. Timesteps stay FP32 and positions
stay FP32/FP64; blanket BF16 input casting is rejected rather than silently
changing their precision. Samples in one microbatch may differ in task
(FL2VA/visual Ref2VA, with or without keyframes), target video/audio geometry,
prompt length, reference count and reference geometry; `DiTDataCollator` fills
keys a sample lacks with `None`, and multi-sample outputs return per-sample
prediction lists. Multi-sample packing rejects Ulysses SP and block/checkpoint
offload inside modeling. Single-device/FSDP2 with SP/CP/TP/PP sizes one is the validation target;
LoRA, compilation and additional parallel/offload combinations are not validated.

FL2VA and Ref2VA layouts now contain exactly `[text | cond | audio | video]`, with
`seq_len=used` and `cu_seqlens=[0, used]`. There is no 64-row tail to crop during
batch packing. Regenerate old cached `packed` metadata with the current builders
before multi-sample training; latent tensors and embeddings need not be re-encoded.
Legacy padded metadata is rejected for multi-sample packing. Any divisibility
padding for single-sample Ulysses remains local to `MiniMaxH3DiT.forward`.
Uncovered SP attention rows are zero-initialized so discarded outputs cannot
introduce nonfinite parameter gradients.

Samples encoded without an audio track keep the silent placeholder latent, so the
layout is unchanged, but carry `has_audio=False` (also saved in offline
embeddings). Their `mse_audio` is zero-weighted, and a packed microbatch takes
the plain sample mean, so after the trainer's division by the accumulation steps
every sample keeps weight `1/G`, as with `micro_batch_size=1`. Normalizing by the
global audio-sample count is not implemented. Caches written without `has_audio`
keep supervising audio as before.

### Visual Ref2VA prepared data

Use matching Ref2VA model weights and **precomputed** Ref2VA prompt/condition
embeddings. The existing FL2VA embedding recipe does not become a Ref2VA encoder.
A decoded offline sample has the usual `input_latents`, `audio_input_latents`,
`prompt_embeds` and `use_gradient_checkpointing`, plus:

```python
from veomni.models.diffusers.minimax_h3.minimax_h3_core.packed_sequence import build_packed_ref2va

# Illustrative geometry; match it to the actual encoded tensors.
ref_blocks = [
    {"kind": "image", "latent_t": 1, "latent_h": 16, "latent_w": 24},
    {"kind": "video", "latent_t": 6, "latent_h": 16, "latent_w": 24},
]
packed = build_packed_ref2va(
    text_len=prompt_embeds.shape[0],
    latent_t=video_latents.shape[2],
    latent_h=video_latents.shape[3],
    latent_w=video_latents.shape[4],
    audio_t=audio_latents.shape[-1],
    audio_channel=audio_latents.shape[0],
    ref_blocks=ref_blocks,
    text_token_tags=text_token_tags,
)
```

Store this `packed` dictionary and `ref_visual_anchor` of shape
`[packed["cond_rows"], 96]` in the existing offline-record format. Anchor rows must
be concatenated in reference-block order and already use the same conditioning
noise augmentation as `model.condition_model_cfg.imgvid_cond_noise_aug`, matching
the native inference reference encoder. Preserve the Ref2VA presentation's text
versus vision token tags. Do not substitute target-video keyframes or FL2VA prompt
embeddings for Ref2VA references. Reference audio is rejected explicitly.

Each sample samples its own timestep/noise through the existing condition path
before packing. The transformer then executes once over compact rows with
independent main-DiT and text-refiner cumulative boundaries. Its RoPE coordinates
stay sample-local; timestep tables are remapped, not assumed shared. Reference
rows are cropped separately for each output. Video/audio signs, unpatchification,
scheduler weights and sample-mean losses retain their single-sample meanings.
For multi-sample inputs, the small text token refiner runs separately for each sample. Its BF16 output
projections can round differently when their GEMM row count changes; the deep
pretrained DiT amplifies those differences. Keeping the refiner sample-local
preserves its serial arithmetic without disabling packing in the main DiT.
This is not a promise of bitwise equality for every packed operator or shape.

AdaLN timestep gathers retain the upstream dtype and backward reduction on both
paths. This feature does not introduce an FP32 gather correction into the shared
H3 implementation. Low-precision repeated-index reductions can vary even between
serial repeats, so packed-gradient comparisons must also measure that baseline
variability; a separate accumulation-precision fix must not silently change the
single-sample path. Sample-local refiner execution is restricted to cross-sample
packing; ordinary single-sample attention dispatch is preserved.

### Attention and validation

- `eager` / `sdpa`: explicit per-segment PyTorch SDPA reference path; main-DiT
  projections and MLPs still operate on compact cross-sample rows.
- `flash_attention_2` / `flash_attention_3` in `model.ops_implementation` resolve
  to VeOmni's local FA2/FA3 backends, and `flash_attention_2_hub` /
  `flash_attention_3_hub` to the Hugging Face Hub kernels
  (`kernels-community/flash-attn2` / `flash-attn3`, version 1). Each main-DiT
  layer uses one non-causal varlen call; refiner layers retain one call per
  sample. The kernel is loaded on the first multi-sample forward and needs
  BF16/FP16; unavailable kernels are not silently replaced with SDPA.

`tests/models/test_minimax_h3_packing.py` uses a native tiny model on CPU to
check packed-versus-serial outputs, losses and gradients (including mixed target
geometry and checkpoint recomputation), sample isolation, Ref2VA variable
references, forward-local SP padding and fail-closed inputs. SP collectives are
mocked there, so it does not establish distributed SP parity. The FA2/FA3 call
site is checked for all four backends with a kernel stub that asserts the
varlen layout; kernel correctness itself is covered by
`tests/ops/test_flash_attn_varlen_padding.py`.
No end-to-end speedup or convergence is claimed. Benchmark against an equivalent,
tuned non-packed baseline before claiming a performance improvement.

## 5. Inference

```shell
python tasks/infer/infer_minimax_h3.py
```

The script runs two tasks sequentially:

1. **t2va**: text-only -> video + audio (480x832, 124 frames, 50 steps)
2. **fl2va**: first frame + last frame + text -> video + audio (832x480 portrait, 124 frames, 50 steps)

Output files (repo root):

- `t2va.mp4`
- `fl2va.mp4`

## 6. Inference Config Notes

All inference config lives in `tasks/infer/infer_minimax_h3.py`:

```python
pipe = MiniMaxH3Pipeline.from_pretrained(
    torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,
    device=device,
    condition_model_path="pretrained_models/MiniMax-H3/MiniMax/MiniMax-H3/FL2VA",
    condition_model_cfg={
        "base_model_path": "pretrained_models/MiniMax-H3/MiniMax/MiniMax-H3/FL2VA",
        "use_keyframe_condition": True,
        "keyframe_indices": [0, -1],       # first and last frames
    },
    transformer_config_path="pretrained_models/MiniMax-H3/MiniMax/MiniMax-H3/FL2VA/transformer/config.json",
    transformer_weights_path="pretrained_models/MiniMax-H3/MiniMax/MiniMax-H3/FL2VA/transformer",
    ops_implementation=OpsImplementationConfig(
        attn_implementation="sdpa",
        rotary_pos_emb_implementation="eager",
        rms_norm_implementation="eager",
        swiglu_mlp_implementation="eager",
        cross_entropy_loss_implementation="eager",
        moe_implementation="eager",
        load_balancing_loss_implementation="eager",
    ),
)
```

Call parameters:

```python
# t2va
video, audio = pipe(
    prompt=prompt,
    height=480, width=832, num_frames=124,   # frame count must satisfy (N-5) % 17 == 0
    num_inference_steps=50, seed=0,          # fewer steps = faster; fixed seed = reproducible
)

# fl2va
video, audio = pipe(
    prompt=prompt,
    height=832, width=480, num_frames=124,
    num_inference_steps=50, seed=0,
    keyframes=[first_frame, last_frame],     # images must exist, otherwise FileNotFoundError
    keyframe_indices=[0, -1],
)
```

**Important**:

- `num_frames` must satisfy `(N-5) % 17 == 0`, otherwise the Video VAE raises an error
