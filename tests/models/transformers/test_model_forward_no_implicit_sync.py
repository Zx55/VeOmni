"""Implicit CUDA-sync gate for VeOmni-patched v5 modeling code.

Runs each model's forward under ``torch.cuda.set_sync_debug_mode("warn")``
and fails if any new implicit host<->device sync site shows up in
first-party ``veomni/models/`` or ``veomni/ops/`` reached by that forward.

``vendor/`` is ignored. ``generated/`` is still allowlisted by
``(basename, qualname)``. Other first-party files use
``(veomni-relative path, qualname)``.

The principle — two axes
------------------------
For each surfaced sync site, decide along two independent axes:

  1. **Owner** — VeOmni-patched (the line appears in the patchgen ``.diff``)
     vs HF-verbatim (the line is unchanged from upstream HF, even though it
     lives inside generated/).
  2. **Path** — production (code runs every real training/inference step,
     no override above it) vs eager-only fallback (code only runs under a
     specific dev/fallback setting; production bypasses it via a ``VeomniOp``
     or other VeOmni override above).

The rule:

  - Production-path + VeOmni-patched  →  fix the patch (derive host-side,
    precompute in the collator, etc.).
  - Production-path + HF-verbatim     →  add an ``override_method`` patch
    and fix there (now becomes ours). **Don't leave a production sync in
    just because the line originated upstream** — that's an unreasonable
    cost in our hot path.
  - Eager-only fallback + HF-verbatim (production bypasses via ``VeomniOp``/
    override)                          →  leave alone, allowlist if needed.
  - Algorithm-essential (EP dispatch sizes, variable per-rank counts) →
    accept.

``_ALLOWED_SYNCS`` therefore holds two flavours of entries, distinguished
by a tag prefix in the reason string:

  - ``"HF-eager-only: ..."``          — accepted long-term; production
                                        bypasses this code.
  - ``"HF-prod-pending-fix: ..."``    — production-path HF-verbatim site
                                        currently tracked for a fix
                                        (follow-up PR named in the reason).
  - ``"algorithm-essential: ..."``    — accepted by design.
  - ``"public-entry-fallback: ..."``  — allowed only when host metadata is
                                        missing (for example GPU ``cu_seq_lens_q``
                                        on the public DSV4 entry).

The dead-entry detection ensures the pending-fix entries get cleaned up
when the fix lands.

Why this matters
----------------
Patched modeling can quietly serialise the host against the device by
turning a 0-D GPU scalar into a Python int (``.item()`` / ``int(t)``),
slicing with a GPU tensor, calling ``repeat_interleave(GPU_repeats)``,
``if gpu_tensor:``, etc. Invisible during compute-heavy steps; expensive
under SP/EP and small micro-batches, and can cascade into NCCL watchdog
timeouts. See ``/veomni-debug`` for the manual investigation flow against
real weights.

This test is the *unit-level ratchet*: it runs on toy configs (so only
catches sync sites reachable from a tiny forward) and is cheap enough
to gate PRs. Real-model SP/EP coverage stays with the skill.

Extending to more models
------------------------
Append a ``ForwardCase`` to ``SYNC_FORWARD_CASES`` in ``_forward_cases.py``.
Add a
``_MOE_IMPL_BY_CASE`` entry to override the default ``"eager"``
backend for MoE cases.

When a new model's first run surfaces sync sites, classify each per the
two-axis rule above:

- VeOmni-patched line (appears in the patchgen ``.diff``) → fix the patch.
- HF-verbatim line on a production path (code runs unconditionally, no
  VeOmni override above) → add an ``override_method`` patch to fix it;
  in the meantime allowlist with ``"HF-prod-pending-fix: ..."`` and
  reference the follow-up.
- HF-verbatim line on an eager-only fallback path that production
  bypasses (e.g. inside the eager experts loop, when production
  dispatches to the fused MoE op) → allowlist with
  ``"HF-eager-only: ..."``.

The allowlist is keyed by ``(generated-file, function qualname)``: each
sync warning's line number is resolved to its enclosing function via AST,
so a ``make patchgen`` that shifts lines does **not** rot the gate. Dead
allowlist entries (a function that no longer issues a sync) still fail
the test, so a landed fix can't silently leave a stale entry behind.
